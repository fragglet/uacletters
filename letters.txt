Description             : This is a hallway of words made out of small
                          vertical slices of the UAC logo (SHAWN1). It uses
                          no custom textures and is intended to be a cute
                          hack.

Known Bugs              : With Vanilla Doom, the edges of the textures
                          sometimes overrun slightly, with the effect that
                          undesirable bits of texture pop into the middle of
                          words. This is a limitation of the Doom engine, and
                          won't appear in hi-res source ports.
May Not Run With        : N/A
Tested With             : Chocolate Doom, gzdoom
